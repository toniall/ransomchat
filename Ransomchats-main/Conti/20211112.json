The amount at which we are ready to meet you and keep everything as collateral is $ 1,950,000\nIf you have secured a contract with us, all the consequences stated in this release would not affect you. We always keep the terms of the contract. - before your decision to have a contract with us or not your information will not be published or any other way disclosed. - In case you didnt contact us in 3 days just 1-3% of all your information will be published. You file structure will not be introduced to third parties. - In case of contract with us all the information will be deleted without the any possibility of recovery. You will be provided with the deletion report Despite the rumours spread by recovery companies we have never had any leaks of the data. We mean the data of the clients who have a contract with us and paid it. We are working with facts, not with rumours. And we have facts and proves of some recovery companies who secretly add 10-50% to our price for the client. If you have refused to make a contract with us or you just decided not to start communication, you should know: The dark information market has a turnover of about 500 billion dollars. We are going to loose the additional income so: - Your data will be fully uploaded to public access or never uploaded at all in case you make a contract with us and buy it - You file structure can be and will be introduced to other parties so they can choose what to buy if we didnt make a contract - You files can be sold and we dont care about the way those files will be used and where those files will be published. The main idea is that you can settle the wave the lawsuits and claims but in a few years the information that was sold can appear again as a a new data breach and you will have to solve that problem again and again.\nAfter payment you will get decryptors to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked.",
