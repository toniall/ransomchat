I had no idea that 2020 was going to be as bad as it was. I still have inventory on my lot from 13 months ago. That's unheard of in my business! I'm hoping 2021 turns around and is better, but until then, I'm just trying to survive. Car dealerships are very low margin, meaning that if I'm able to sell a few cars, the revenue doesn't necessarily cover my bills or employee salaries. I need to sell a certain level of inventory to make a profit and most months I didn't. I've had to furlough employees just to try to keep the dealership open. I'm willing to do whatever it takes and to work with you for as long as it takes, but I only have $72,380 that I can pay you to unlock my files.",
