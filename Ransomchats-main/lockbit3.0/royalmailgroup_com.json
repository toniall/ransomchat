Our Company\u2019s revenue is in decline, as we have tried to explain to you previously and Royal Mail International is the Company that is affected by your penetration testing.

If there is any negotiation at this percentage level the starting figure needs to represent what I have just described. I am trying to help our Senior Team understand this and I am grateful that you have offered to help them see that your decryptor can work to restore our services, by offering to decrypt some larger files.
