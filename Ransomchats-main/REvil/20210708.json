We just don\u2019t have that kind of money. Here is what we do have. First, my boss has cancelled the reopening of the office for the rest of the year, which was earmarked at $30,000. It turns out we have an insurance policy that could help out as well. (I was not aware of this). The insurance is $100,000. Finally, my boss will personally contribute his own family money of $20,000. That is $150,000! I know it is not as much as you wanted, but please look at what we are doing here. My boss also wanted me to ask you to look at the financial records that you stole from us. He wanted me to tell you that if you look at those documents, they show that our company has a \u201cnegative returned earnings value\u201d. I don\u2019t know what that means, but my boss said that as a businessman, you would understand",
