We also only use [redacted-software-vendor]'s \"Reservation\" and \"Point of Sale\" system like the other poor souls above. We are all trying to make a decent living after Covid struck, and we in the hospitality sector suffered the most without being able to trade fully for 12-18 months. So with hardly being able to pay our staff where do you think we will be able to get US Dollars to pay you? Our US exchange rate is currently [redacted-currency] to 1$. You should hack the [redacted-location] government because they will be the only ones who can afford to pay you in US$... So please be reasonable and hack the big guys in the future not us on the ground trying to make a living. [redacted] Thanks and awaiting your reply...",
