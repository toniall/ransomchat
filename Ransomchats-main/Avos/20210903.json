Even if you have thousands of user  accounts, you should probably only have 2-5 administrator accounts.  Start with two accounts and force users to justify any additional  accounts added to the administrator group. The next thing that you  should do is upgrade the schema and functional level of your forest and  domain to at least 2012 R2. This domain functional level adds a fairly  new group called \u201cProtected Users\u201d. Along with other protections, the  members of the Protected Users group cannot authenticate by using NTLM,  Digest Authentication, or CredSSP. These changes provide powerful  protections that make Mimikatz almost worthless. Verify KB2871997 has  been installed to apply additional required security. After you install  this security update, the default setting for non-protected users on  Windows 7 and Windows 8 is to not force clear leaked logon session  credentials.",
