DATA_HANDLING:
- sir, your silence will only worsen the situation. after the publication of the data that we have, your company will have very big problems, because lawsuits, proceedings and compensation will cause you devastating damage.
you can avoid all these problems by starting negotiations with us.
otherwise, we will soon publish a press release on our data leak blog and the whole world will know that your companyâ€™s servers have been compromised.
- more than 50gb of confidential and sensitive data was stolen from your network.
if you do not negotiate with us, all data will be published on our data leak blog

- hello.
your company's servers/computers have been encrypted and compromised by noescape ransomware.

to get our special software to recover all your files, you need to send us the amount in bitcoin shown on your page. that's roughly the equivalent of $80,000

you should know that only we can recover your files and no one else. only we have the software that can do this. if you try to restore it yourself or someone else tries to do it, your files will be permanently deleted.

ENCRYPTION:
- in order to check that we can actually recover your files, you can use the test decryptor on your page. you need to upload 1 image up to 5mb in size.
