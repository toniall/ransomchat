data there and downloaded it, i see no point in this question, we always
 do this, these are our methods, did you see our blog? you have two 
options to get the files: after payment or publicly on the blog.
- everything happens automatically after payment.
- we are not ready to stretch the time like that.
all my boss is willing to offer is tuesday night, if payment is received by then.
- if you are willing to pay quickly, we will approve the amount of 600k. but this is only in case of quick payment.
- btc enabled update
- we provide a complete file tree for complete confidentiality after 
payment arrives at our account, the data is automatically deleted along 
with the server.
- if you think its easy to restore for 800k - go and do it. we dont care.
 first dump will be full of your client net passwords, [redacted] email 
dump, phone and password(that he use in many other services than your 
network). next will be with clients info, ndas, payment infromation and 
technical specification of your production
- this is an example of files that we downloaded. all files you will receive after payment.

https://www.binance.com/en/trade/xmr_btc
https://hitbtc.com/xmr-to-usdt
https://www.hbg.com/en-us/exchange/xmr_usdt
and there are all of the ways to get monero
https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/#exchanges
- of course , btc enabled
- then ask your technician if they can help you with personal data leaks.
also, in case of non-payment, your information will be published in our blog and disseminated in the media.
- my boss is ready to give you a 20% discount on fast payment.
- you can use bitcoin instead of monero, but it will be more expensive for you in case of our merchant additional fee,
so if u want to pay in btc u need to add +10%. btc enabled
- i repeat bitcoin transactions are tracked and the payment gateway takes a commission to clear them
- btc or xmr
- 4 days ago you have asked for additional time to buy xmr, at now you 
write like you only now start consider payment process. who play games? 
you already had plenty of time to make a decision and consider different
 options. now your task is to go to the boss and come to me with the 
answer. the timer will not be moved until i get information about the 
deal.
- such information is provided only after payment.
- everything is up to you, quick payment in a short period of time, implies a good relationship and conditions of redemption.
- we recommend that you transfer this information to the management.
we are ready for dialogue if you want to solve this problem.
we will not drag out negotiations.
we know the level of damage done to your network.
also, our team received a large amount of important information that 
will become publicly available if you do not pay or try to make too low 
offers.
for our part, we are ready to provide a 20% discount if payment reaches us by wednesday.this is our goodwill gesture.
- i remind you once again that all our agreements are valid only in case 
of quick payment. it seems to us that you are deliberately delaying the 
dialogue.
- you will receive complete data only after payment. we can only give an example of the data taken.
- we provide this information only after payment along with the audit of your network.
- the first part of the data is being prepared for publication soon, if 
you have a proposal for payment, my boss is ready to listen.
- hello. we have deals with many companies every day, our pricing policy 
takes into account the covid19 crisis. do not take cover by this, the 
price is affordable for the company. 500k from a company like your is 
not seriously, of course we can give you a discount that will depend on 
the quickness of your payment, but price can't be too low as you ask 
for. we hid the post from our blog for the talks. if we will have a deal
 this information will not be ever published.
- our team noticed that you have already started spreading dirty rumors to other companies.
so, look, if this continues, we are starting data recovery for all the cases that we have worked with previously.
publishing all remote blogs and spreading information in the media that your companies (victims) paid us a ransom.
don't consider yourself an almighty friend.
a new hacker worked with your case, who foolishly deleted the data after payment. this will no longer be the case, and rest assured that we do not store the data of the victims you paid for. let's forget about this case and continue working. don't try to fight.
- let my boss think, next couple of hours.

in any case, we are not ready for a down payment of 50%. so we don't work.
you can send us some not very important files so that we can confirm the functionality of our build. to do this, skip the file and note this extension.

i'll tell you in advance if the boss does not agrees to 40.000, try to offer a little more.
- what do you mean by "positive indication" ? another meeting on thursday ? or preparing for payment ?
- btc enabled , price update
- we will tell only after payment
- how much time will it take you to make the payment?
- if i understand correctly, your last offer is $1.27m, if we will agree, how many time do you need to make the payment?
- first, we do not accept payments to a bank account.
secondly, our boss is unhappy with your proposal.
- our agreement is valid until monday night, i have nothing more to add for you.
the discount is provided for quick payment.
- we remind you that in case of non-payment the timer will double the payment amount.
- my boss can offer 20% discount for fast payment
- you can submit your proposal and my boss will review it.
the faster the payment arrives, the more discount we will give you.
as proof, we can provide any of your data.
- you can find btc id on main page
- hello. are we waiting for your payment today?
- i recommend that you do not trust such reports.
we don't know what information the coveware report was based on.
how many companies are using coveware?
what is the size of the company and what is their revenue?
was there a data leak?
or was the company able to recover on its own and the company was interested only in non-disclosure?
company profiles?
and much more.

we also recommend that you be extremely careful when contacting a company like coveware.
as practice shows, the task of such companies is to make money on the client's problem. most often they use payment per hour.
therefore, they usually start to play for time during negotiations and thereby pull money from the client.
they won't care about your data. and if the deal does not take place, 
then the data is published and companies like coveware will do it anyway
 for this fact - they will still make money.
they are often too confident that we will agree to any amount and will 
not publish the data, but you can take a look at our blog and see how 
many companies they faked in this way.
it is also a frequent case when we publish the first part of the data - 
companies immediately go to the deal, understanding how serious 
everything is.

returning to the topic of statistics of payments and amounts - as you 
understand, the companies that ignite do not want publicity, so you 
rarely see news that the company paid 5-10-15-20 million. but this 
happens.
here is a public example for you, to which we have nothing to do, but i think the meaning will be clear:
https://www.wired.com/story/garmin-ransomware-hack-warning/

this is a public event. the company did not want to pay, after which 
part of its data was published and as far as i know - after that the 
company quickly agreed to the deal.

i could provide private evidence of other multi-million dollar deals, but of course i won't.
we do business with integrity. all the more would you like it if in the 
future we would tell other companies about your case? if we come to a 
deal, no one will know about it, otherwise you will be another example 
for our other companies.

as for the amount.
i think you perfectly understand that you will incur large financial 
losses. you are already losing money and i don’t think you want it to 
continue like this. and now we are only talking about easy to work with.
 but do you understand that there will be other losses?
clients will find out about what happened to you and find out that their
 data has been published, including confidential. including problems 
with their projects. i think it is not easy for them not to want to 
continue working with you, and they will also sue you. and probably it 
will also go about millions of claims.
so what happens if competitors take advantage of the data we can publish?
how will investors react to this?
believe me, there is enough data for the company to incur more serious losses and they will exceed the amount requested from us.

we are not the first day in this business and we can conditionally 
calculate how much the company can and will be willing to pay. as well 
as possible losses of the company. therefore, we offer an adequate 
amount and it does not include the discount that we can offer if the 
company conducts a correct and serious conversation, and is also ready 
to conduct a deal up to double the amount and publish the first part of 
the data.

we are still waiting for a serious offer from you. keep in mind that 
tomorrow we will be preparing the first publication for our blog 
regarding your company - we are going to publish it on friday if we do 
not come to an agreement. the blog is followed by many media and as soon
 as a new entry appears there, after a few hours it appears on many news
 portals.
- let me remind you that this offer is valid only in case of quick payment.
- as we said, this is a small part of the data, we will not discard all 
the data that we have. but after payment we will delete all copies of 
the data
- you can use bitcoin instead of monero, but it will be more expensive for you in case of our merchant additional fee,
so if u want to pay in btc u need to add +10%. or u can simply buy 
monero on this exchanges and withdraw on ur own wallet and send to us.

and there are all of the ways to get monero
https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/#exchanges
- how much time do you need to make this payment?
- stolen [redacted] data are published in the blog in case of payment refusal or you receive a link to the files after payment.
- 10% commission is charged by our payment processor, we have nothing to do with this money.
below 300k we will not accept
- i provide you additional proofs below and recommend you hurry up with decision, because payment procedure can takes time.
if you don't pay, your files will be published to the blog and shared to
 media, other data will be sold. anyway it will influence to your 
reputation, think about your customers and fines and other troubles 
waiting for you. we offer you solution to avoid everything of this.
- also, after payment, we will conduct a full audit of your network in order to avoid subsequent hacks.
- hello
we see no attempts on your part to engage in a serious conversation.
if you do not pay, your files will be published on the blog and 
transferred to the media, the rest of the data will be sold. in any 
case, it will affect your reputation, think about your clients, fines 
and other troubles awaiting you. you will not have more time if we do 
not see the prepayment.
- ok, we will provide you the list and any details after payment, no problem
- after payment we will conduct an audit for you.
- in case of quick payment, we are ready to offer you a 20% discount
- i have included the possibility of payment in btc, refresh the page.

DATA_HANDLING:
- if this data is useless, what are you doing here? if you have nothing to pay so much for, then why are you discussing the price?
either make an offer that will interest my boss, or the publication will be in 19 hours and the "dancing" will end.
- we have started transferring some of the data to the new server so that
 you can familiarize yourself with the data. it will take some time. in 5
 minutes you will be able to get acquainted with what we have already 
transferred for you.
- you have 30 minutes left until posting.
don't you give a damn about a personal data leak?
- the data was deleted automatically, we, for our part, did not have time to save the deletion log
- hi, tomorrow we upload your data to auction .and after sale start spam attack to your partner with your data
- this is just business, it makes no sense for us to lie or not fulfill 
obligations. if we do business this way, there will be no profit for us.
in fact, you question is very strange - we think that the provided data 
is already enough to understand the seriousness of your problem. it's 
all about your reputation and possible damage to your customers.
we have been in your network for more than 2 weeks and we think you 
understand that there was enough time to download even more information.
you can also read about revil on the internet and find out that 500 
gigabytes is a small leak, since sometimes several terabytes of data are
 downloaded.
and also you will find out that if we can't reach the agreemnt, then we will have to publish some of the data in our blog.
you should also know that in 5 days the amount will be doubled.
- hello, we are tired of waiting for you, if there is no response from 
you in a day, we will publish screenshots of some of your files for the 
media - this will be the first warning for you.
but even if it does not affect you, we will publish all your data. we recommend that you make a decision.
- i have nothing more to add data will be sold and you must understand this
- near 140gb of data

it is in your interests to quickly agree on the ransom amount and pay 
quickly, and we will give you a discount. we are waiting for suggestions
 from you.
- what kind of files do you call "special"? can you be a bit more 
specific. we've got plenty of your files, but we can't know what exactly
 to pick to satisfy you. we've got your financial files, personal 
information of all of your employees and clients, engineering and etc. 
if all this data will be published, believe us, it will cause a way more
 damage than the price we want.

20% is all we have to offer
- ok, we take you the last step to meet $ 100k.
- hello, are you ready to pay ?
- if you have undertook many negotiations with revil you have to know that much smaller companies pay more than your offer.
- i think there were reasons for that, it is not for nothing that they 
reduce the price to 750k from 7.5m, you are too mistaken in thinking 
that the situation is the same here. i could cite cases when companies 
with ten times less revenue paid 3m, or paids 100k only for one personal
 computer, but it is not create rule, it is just an exception, 
exceptions only confirm the rule.
- i passed the information directly to the boss and everything he has to offer 650k
- 2 days added
- yes that's right.
- hello we deleted all information about company
- small example
- ok. price updated.
- examples
- if my boss intervenes in this dialog, then it will not be 
communication, but two words and a timer per day, you are still lucky to
 deal with me, because i have time to answer you.
- wait for answer
- spam attack
- price fixed
- friends, you apparently did not understand, we are ready to provide you with a 20% discount from the original price.
- make a really interested offer for my boss
- ok we wait
- we can provide you with a new private chat without verification, but if
 we are confused by the correspondence in it, we will return to the main
 chat, where we are currently communicating.
- okay my boss agree price update you can pay.
- this amount was formed after a detailed audit of your company and it fully corresponds to your level and size of your company.
- are we gonna talk about money? there will be no more dates, don't ask more about it.
- i talked with my boss so the last price is 50.000$ it is the minimal price we can offer to you.
- hi. we find a login to https://remote.[redacted].com
- time added. price update.
- we can add time
- my boss is not interested in this amount.
you have a few days before publishing in the blog and in the media
- companies that are traded on stock exchanges, solve the problem in 12 
hours, i say this because i know. i see that your actions are only aimed
 at delaying the solution of this incident.
- what results do you want to tell about? we've done enough to keep you in trouble for years to come.
- ok
- file 2
- you were too slow when trying to assess the damage and did not write to us
- send another file
- good morning. sorry, but your offer still isnt interesting for us. 
companies with revenue like 10kk usually pays us this value. comeback 
later when you will be able to pay more. we can wait but your client 
doesnt have enough time.
- that's why i said to you that your client need to use 2fa on citrix server.
- hello, ok.
- we have already given you time to discuss these issues at your meeting today.
my boss isn't ready to give you time until wednesday.
- okay we wait.
- hello , are you ready for dialogue ?
- hello, our communication is conducted only through this chat.
we are ready to listen to your proposal.
- make a really interesting offer to my boss. 12k euro its small offer.
- 300k and okay if you pay quickly
- we are not interested in this.
we have indicated the amount for you.
your proposal sounds stupid.
if you are not willing to pay more.
bye
- sorry. i cant give you that information.
- you can show your boss the instructive stories of other companies that refused to pay the ransom.
- you should make an offer above otherwise we will not be able to agree
- your suggestions don't even come close to meeting our needs
- 30 minutes
- these are lines from your documents.
- hello , yes.
- wait for 3 confirmations by bitcoin system, it takes ~30 min
- no, i mean the credit card details of your clients or employees.
- no, this violates our privacy policy.
- waiting for your...
- yes.
- we never commit malicious acts while communicating.
these words are confirmed by our reputation.
- good. we will be in touch.
- 25k and okay not lower
- why do we need this? we have removed all information that could help someone identify your company name.
- yes
- yes. we buy it. somebody of your clients employee was infected but not by us.
- from several hours to a day
- then pay in monero 300k
- you ask for too much time
- we wait.
- 170000-20%=136000 $
- okay , we added.
- think not about the fact that we will not make a profit, think about 
the problems that will arise after publication. have a good day, too.
- correction, file with id "readme-[redacted].txt" is required.
- after 12 hours, the amount will return to 1kk
- we have voiced our proposal to you earlier if you cannot approach it then there is no point in continuing the dialogue
- ok, but in return i reduce the timer for decision making.
- if during the day my boss does not receive a response from you, attacks
 on your network will continue, i hope your management will be 
pleasantly surprised.
- you can read about travalex, a very instructive story. they had the 
opportunity to prevent it, as a result, this error became inexcusably 
expensive for them.
- hello , yes
- if your senior management is unwilling to pay, we will start publishing information, be sure to remind them of this.
- the price is set after a financial audit of your company. we understand
 the situation with covid, so we are ready to hear your proposal for a 
price. but please note that we do not expect a low price from you. don't
 forget that we have your financial statements when you make your bid.
- we do not issue invoices
- nope. you need to pay the requested amount of money. it is not a market.
- any news ?
- we have been administrators of your network for a long time and we know
 how much you are willing to pay. our latest offer is 700k but that's 
all
- this is a confirmation of the transaction in the blockchain network. the usual procedure for transferring cryptocurrencies.
- we are sure.
you have nothing to worry about.
- but we do not guarantee recovery if you carry out any manipulations with these servers.
- to solve your problem, you need to increase your offer by at least 10-fold.
- today we are waiting for the results of your negotiations from you.
- okay.
- publication of your information will create damage much more valuable 
than our requirements. think about it, you have the minimal price and we
 usually don't negotiate about it.
- okay
- not interested.
- then you need to collect money
- an article in our blog will be prepared tonight (not published at the moment).
perhaps this way your bosses will want to pay faster.
- hello.you offer is very small.not interested.
- everything my boss has to offer $ 136k.
- so your boss has to get in touch with us himself. you're an incompetent negotiator.
- wait for answer.
- then we will not be able to agree
- i added you 7 days.
- well, we are ready to listen to your questions.
- make a really interesting offer to my boss. and we can work.
- part of random lines from the tree file
- good. 10 minutes and we will provide you with screenshots.

- then we'll do it.
- yes, you are right, for our part we want to see the best deal that you can afford.
- yes , all right.
- 90k our last price
- the price below is not interesting to us
- you work for a company, don't bluff with us
- my boss can offer 20% discount
- file
- news?
- i do not need to be persuaded, go to the boss and come back with an answer, you have little time left.
- how long will they take?
- i would like to remind you that we are not ready to drag out 
negotiations. in case of waiting for long answers, there can be no 
question of any discounts from our side.
- sorry for the failed submission last time.
- you write a lot of text but all of this doesnt matter. why ? [redacted] is one
 of the world's largest manufacturers of [redacted]. your 
client spent some millions on recovery software and hardware for it, but
 admins using passwords like "[weak password redacted]". but sure we cant take your 1m 
offer because this is ridiculous. we are thinking that you are bluffing 
and trying to make price so lower, but i understand it is just your job.
 you working fine, price updated to $5m
- your price is still too low for this amount of work.
- hello , my boss can offer 20% discount

- to much time - we can expend timer only until monday
- price update you can pay.
- waiting for 10 confirmations by monero system, it takes ~30 min
- hey! do you have any news for us, guys?
- i am not going to enter into long correspondence and polemics anymore. 
you know the terms and conditions and they will remain unchanged.
- we are talking about publishing information that we have downloaded. if
 you pay before saturday, we will give an extra 20% discount.

- price update
- [redacted]_consolidated financial report 310320.pdf
- password- [redacted]
- but we cant accept 55k
- okay we give until wednesday.
- it doesn't matter for us whether you need decoders or not, for us this is not an argument, one way or another you will get them
- we are ready to consider the issue of the discount again, but what you are offering sounds silly.
- not lower
- we will not be able to link the gmail account with the your company.
linkedin account or facebook of an employee or company?
phone call?

after you provide us with a contact for communication, we will remove it from our correspondence so that no one can see it
- hi
- 20% discount its all.
- at this stage of negotiations - my answer is no. the situation may 
change if we find a compromise and reach an agreement. i do the same as 
you and follow the instructions of my boss. tonight he will get 
acquainted with the dialogue and if there are new instructions, you will
 learn about it.
- if you think the card details of their owners are important, then yes, they are.

- 5 monero receive
- our agreement 300k will not be lower
- yes we are listening to you.
- the price depends on your income
- "as the board is considering options, do you have a new number so i can
 take to them board." - what number are we talking about?
- 3 day added
- yes for all network
- in view of this situation, $ 5m is reasonable.
- hello!
we took note of your communication and concluded:

1) if you could cope without our help, you would not contact us.

2) and yet, we are ready to make concessions to you, and throw the price down to $75,000.

we await your decision.
- i will set the timer for you until october 14, in my opinion this is 
enough to make a decision. as for the discount, i might be able to 
convince the boss to give it to you, but you ask for many extra days.
- you shouldn't use the old tricks.
leave your email with you
- we gave you enough time to make a decision. if your boss doesn't want 
to pay $6kk but wants to get off with a smaller amount, let him hurry.
- there is nothing we can do to help.
our latest offer is 300k. if not, we will simply publish your details.
we made maximum concessions
- these are not our problems
- 1.295
- https://www.sendspace.com/file/[redacted]
- when the time expires, this post will be published.
- wait

- i have a boss

- i must say right away that the amount is less than 1kk my boss is not interested
- we are not in the mood for a long conversation, so we look forward to hearing from you shortly.
- is 2 days enough for you?
- prolonging the process only aggravates the problem.
- yes, we can help you secure your network
- we all perfectly understand, but there are certain algorithms and 
deadlines in our work, which have proven their effectiveness more than 
once.
- not interested
- do you really take us for fools?
- refresh the page to see changes

ENCRYPTION:
- we would like to draw your attention to the fact that we did not delete
 data from your esxi servers. the information is also encrypted there. 
if we make a deal, we will give you a decryptor so that you can restore 
the servers.
- if you are ready to move on to the deal in the near future, then we can
 provide you with a discount. if you do not need a decryptor, then the 
discount will be slightly higher.
- we are revil group.
we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is $2,500,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 7 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company.
- we have a long reputation, you can read reviews about us.
in addition, you ask to decrypt the server with backups.

we have already done everything possible for our cooperation in the form of a proposed discount.

you will receive a utility that will run on all extensions at once on your network.
- no , you will get universal decryptor for all extension
- after that we made a kerberoasting attack and decrypt admin hash "12qwer34". that's all.
- hello,

we are revil group.
we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is $300,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 3 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company.
you can find more information about revil group in google.



posting on our blog and further publications in the media will lead to significant losses for your company: court and government fines, data recovery, loss of reputation, abandonment of clients, drop in limits.

but don't panic! we are in business, not in war.
we can unblock your data and keep everything secret. all we need is a ransom.
in this case, you also get: a security report, a complete tree of compromised data files, permanently deleting downloaded data, support with tips on unlocking and protecting.

in this case, you also get: a security report, a complete tree of compromised data files, permanently deleting downloaded data, support with tips on unlocking and protecting.
- the price is formed solely on the fact that you need to completely delete the data and everything from points 2-6.
for a decryptor, the payment will be much higher.
- hello,  we are revil group. we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is $3.000,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 3 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company. you can find more information about revil group in google.    posting on our blog and further publications in the media will lead to significant losses for your company: court and government fines, data recovery, loss of reputation, abandonment of clients, drop in limits.  but don't panic! we are in business, not in war. we can unblock your data and keep everything secret. all we need is a ransom. in this case, you also get: a security report, a complete tree of compromised data files, permanently deleting downloaded data, support with tips on unlocking and protecting.
- do you want us to give you a discount of more than 90%? of course this is impossible.
i will give you a small example. the company is close to your profile, 
the annual turnover was 2.5 times less, as well as we had 2 times less 
data and we have already published some of the data in the blog - as a 
result, this company paid 4 million.
they also did not need a decryptor - they were able to recover from the backups that we missed.
next comes simple math.
what you read is either small companies or information with understated 
amounts. most companies do not advertise the fact of hacking and 
payment.
- by concluding a deal with us, you receive a decryptor file for all your
 data, we completely delete all your data from our servers, and 
guarantee you complete confidentiality about the incident. your 
reputation will not be affected. you also get a brief audit of an attack
 on your network, which will allow you to further reduce the risk of 
such incidents recurring.
- after payment you receive:
- universal decryptor for your all network
- the complete deletion of all your files with our warranty not to use the data for any purpose.
- 100% confidentiality of this incident and all terms of the transaction on our part.
- complete audit of your network to prevent similar attacks in the future
- we send universal decryptor and all instruction
- we are ready to consider options for a deferred payment if you pay 300k
 now and receive a decryptor and 300k the next day for non-dissemination
 of your data.
- hello.this amount was formed after a detailed audit of your company and
 it fully corresponds to your level and size of your company.
the system works as follows: you transfer the amount in crypt currency monero (xmr) to the wallet specified on your page.
after payment you receive:
- universal decryptor for your all network
- 100% confidentiality of this incident and all terms of the transaction on our part.
- after payment, the system will generate and give you a universal decryptor that will work on any device in your network.
- hello. the decryptor is obtained automatically after payment.
- we value our reputation and we have proved ourselves over a long period
 of time. we have a 100% guarantee after the transaction is completed 
that you will receive the decryptor and your data and information about 
you will be immediately deleted.
- you pay for fullfill decryption your files and we tell you about your 
vulnerabilities and how to fix them. otherwise you will face new 
different attacks, sooner or later it will lead to leaks of your and 
your client's data and other valuable data again and again.
- we are ready to consider options for a deferred payment if you pay 255k
 now and receive a decryptor and 355k the next day for non-dissemination
 of your data.
- if you need decryptor pay.
- to use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before.
you can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd.

cmd commands:
dec.exe -full
dec.exe -path "c:\folder"
dec.exe -file "c:\folder\file.txt.random_ext"

* decryptor with -full option will decrypt all with default params.

if you use it as gui application, i recommend you choose "create 
backups" option. if you use decryptor without this option, you should 
not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be 
irreversibly damaged.

how it works with "create backups" option:
1. decryptor looking for encrypted file
2. creating backup of file
3. decrypting file
4. removing the backup
5. looking for a next file and loop repeating.

you can collect list of extensions, input to the textarea above the chat
 and click "download" to generate general decryptor to decrypt files 
with these extensions.
but this way is not necessary, because we provide you the universal 
decryptor. it just works little slowest but you don't need collect 
anything, just download it and use on any system with admin rights, 
download:
- hello,

we are revil group.
we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is $5,000,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us within 6 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company.

- we have good news to you, price $2.5m for this deal. we prefer monero, 
but provide you bitcoin payment method to make it easier for you. but 
there is a nuance, if you pay in bitcoins, the additional commission is 
10%.
after payment we will fulfill all agreements with decryption, will 
provide any supports, delete the data from our servers and will provide 
you short report on how you were hacked, keep in mind we still have 
access to the network and watching for any movements.
- understand one thing and bring it to your boss, decryptor and 
confidentiality is need not for us, but for you. do not scare us without
 paying, there are dozens of you, it is better to concentrate on your 
problem.
- yes. general decryptor works for all system that was affected
- 1. we fix the amount of the transaction after the final value is approved.
2. you pay the ransom in moneon or bitcoin.
3. after payment you get a universal decryptor for all infected computers.
4. you get a set of links that contain your files.
5. after downloading your files are deleted from our servers without the possibility of recovery.
6. no one but us will know about this incident.
- hello,

we are revil group.

- to decrypt the second file, i need a note with the id "readme-[redacted].txt". send it to me in this chat.
- to use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before.
you can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd.

cmd commands:
universaldecryptor.exe -full
universaldecryptor.exe -path "c:\folder"
universaldecryptor.exe -file "c:\folder\file.txt.random_ext"

if you use it as gui application, mi recommend you choose "create 
backups" option. if you use decryptor without this option, you should 
not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be 
irreversibly damaged.
- we can agree to 35k and we guarantee that you will be able to decrypt all your files
- 1) you can recover this data using the decryptor anyway. but if required, we will provide you with a link to all your data.
2) yes, we will provide you with information on how we got into the company's network and how we got access to all the data.
3) we don't do that kind of thing. this will ruin our reputation. we 
will give you recommendations on how to avoid repeated intrusion (from 
other teams).
4) why will we not save them - why waste resources on this? as soon as 
we receive payment, we will delete the data from all backup servers and 
it will remain on only one server so that you can download it if you 
need it. then we will remove them from there.
this is a business. if we leak, we will ruin our reputation and other companies will not pay us.
5) our software is time-tested. this will not happen if you have not tried to restore data using third-party software.
- we've finished copying the sample data for you.
can you please tell me, are you only interested in data files or are you also interested in the decryptor?
as we already wrote before, we strongly discourage using third-party solutions.
- the system works as follows: you transfer the amount in crypt currency monero (xmr) to the wallet specified on your page.
after payment you receive:
- universal decryptor for your all network
- the complete deletion of all your files with our warranty not to use the data for any purpose.
- deleting blog
- 100% confidentiality of this incident and all terms of the transaction on our part.
- to use a decryptor run it as administrator and turn off antivirus before.
you can use a decryptor as gui application or through cmd.

cmd commands:
universaldecryptor.exe -full
universaldecryptor.exe -path "c:\folder"
universaldecryptor.exe -file "c:\folder\file.txt.random_ext"

* decryptor with -full option will decrypt all with default params.

if you use it as gui application, mi recommend you choose "create backups" option. if you use decryptor without this option, you should not interrupt decryption process, otherwise some files will be irreversibly damaged.
- hello,

we are revil group.
we want to inform that your company local network have been hacked and 
encrypted. we have all your local network data. the price to unlock is 
$1,000,000. now we're keeping it a secret, but if you do not reply us 
within 3 days it will be posted on our news-site. think about the 
financial damage to your stock price from this publication. in case of 
successful negotiations we guarantee that you will get decryptors for 
all your machines, non recoverable removal of downloaded data and 
security report on how you were hacked to fix your vulnerabilities. we 
hope that you can correctly assess the risks for your company.
you can find more information about revil group in google.



posting on our blog and further publications in the media will lead to 
significant losses for your company: court and government fines, data 
recovery, loss of reputation, abandonment of clients, drop in limits.

but don't panic! we are in business, not in war.
we can unblock your data and keep everything secret. all we need is a ransom.
in this case, you also get: a security report, a complete tree of 
compromised data files, permanently deleting downloaded data, support 
with tips on unlocking and protecting.
- now print out the whole dialogue and bring it to your boss. we can go 
back to the previous timer, after which the amount will be doubled and 
there will be no discounts. there is no one here who is going to play 
games with you, or we make a deal and you get a decryptor + link to your
 files. or just close the dialog and do not waste your time.
- you need to make a payment and you will get a universal decryptor for your entire network.
- do i understand correctly that you do not need a decryptor?
- 3rd party solutions - various programs, the descriptions of which say 
that they can recover data, but this is not the case. typically, the use
 of such third-party programs leads to the fact that our decryptor can 
no longer recover your data.
- these are just your problems.
nobody made you pay other teams to get well.
our decryptor completed this in a few hours.
20% discount is all that we are ready to offer
- my reaction is the result of your work. i don't see before me people 
who value their business, i see attempts to study the possibility of 
mitigation of the attack. we really keep our promises, there is no need 
to doubt it. we give the decryptor, we give references to the stolen 
files, we publish the files in case of a deal failure. and now we can 
imagine that we are adults and can discuss the deal.
- waiting till 3 conformations,after that you can download decryption program
- you can try trial decryption to make sure we unblock everything

PROOF:
- we prepare proof of hack
- yes we prepaid proof of hack
- proof-
- proof 3
