- whats your offer?
- before the attack we checked info about your company, so it's 
absolutely useless to prove us anything. discount is possible, but not 
in the amount you want. you can try to take a loan and find any 
cryptobrocker who will resolve all the cryptocurrency exchange.

- we do not make such big discounts.
- ok! have a nice day!
- ok, we can see your transaction
- hello!
- we will not list your tomorrow, in case of agreement.
- discount x100 from first amount is impossible. 
we can reduce the price by 50 000. so you have to pay 950 000 $
- you have the last day to resolve this.
we are ready for a dialog, you should write.
- where do you get this error?
- look, if you were a non-profit organization, you wouldn't be 
attacked by anyone. everyone can say that they are helping someone.
in the current case, your offer does not meet our expectations. it will 
get you nowhere and you are wasting your time. give us a better price 
and we will give you a discount.
- i understand you, as far as i know in europe there are bitcoin atms for a long time

ENCRYPTION:
- hello! the process of decryption is similar to the encryption process, 
you do not need to worry, maximum 4-5 hours and your files will be 
decrypted
- if you have any other problems with decryption - i will help you, just give me not empty files.
- we gave you decryptors and they work, if you have problems with them, i will help you.
- just run the decryptor on each esxi, that's all, you don't need to do anything anymore
- windows:

the decryptor works in 2 modes:
1. gui
2. console

three functions are available in gui mode:
1. "decrypt all" - search and decrypt all encrypted files on the local 
pc and on network resources (shares), where this pc has access.
2. "decrypt folder" - decrypts files in the specified folder, which you 
can select in the "browse for folders" window or drag and drop the 
folder into the decryptor window.
3. "decrypt one file" - decrypts a single file, which you can open in 
the "open" window or drag and drop the encrypted file into the decryptor
 window.

important!
extension of encrypted files may not coincide with the extension of files, which the decryptor suggests to open!
to open encrypted files with other extensions, in the "open" window 
select, in the lower right corner of "all files (*. *)" or just drag and
 drop the given file into the decryptor window.
file extension does not affect the decryption of file!

console mode has two parameters:
1. "-all" - search and decrypt all encrypted files on the local pc and on network resources (shares), where this pc has access.
you can also use group policy to quickly decrypt your entire network.
2. "-path" - decrypts files in the specified folder or a single file.
3. dragging and dropping an encrypted file or folder with encrypted files onto the decryptor file.
in this mode, the console window will open automatically, which will display the decryption process.

command line examples:
> decryptor.exe -all
> decryptor.exe -path c:\folder
> decryptor.exe -path c:\folder\file.txt.[redacted]

- any phased payment options are not possible. you pay first, then we 
give you decryptors. if you are not sure, you can give us test files and
 we will decrypt them for you.
- we will send decryptor after payment and help with all. don't worry, it's too easy.
- after payment you will get: decrypt your system (network) file tree 
of data, and i will explain your black holes, (network audit) discount 
we cant make, sorry. you came too late on dialog, thats your problem.
- linux decryption instruction:
1. upload decryptor to esxi.
2. set run permissions: chmod 777 decryptor
3. run decryptor: ./decryptor 
            

lin_decryptor.out
2.3 mb
- if the reason for the non-decryption is that there is 0 size, then i
 cannot help you. the decryptor cannot decrypt what is not.
check all file sizes and tell me them. when you tried to start virtual 
machines, the hypervisor could damage the encrypted files.
i mean before you got the decryptor.
- thanks for your offer, last what we can offer - is change price 
right now to 250 000 usd , and you will pay money in 24 hours, other 
offers we don`t have, because time cost money. we are doing very big 
discount for you. after payment you will get - full decrypt of your 
systems, and we will delete all your data from our servers.
- the process works as when encrypting only in the opposite direction, we 
will also send all instructions, and provide support until you decrypt 
the all network
- the decryptor checks all checksums, it could not damage virtual 
machines. this is the first time that a client talks about problems.
did you check the sized before decryption?
- and after 3 confirmation of bitcoin network we will send you decryptors and instruction
- before buying decryptors, you saw that some files were empty and you could not pay.
- you should upload decryptor to each esxi, set 777 permissions and 
run. that's all you need, after small time your esxis will be ready for 
work.
- this amount is not enough. raise the price and we will give you an additional discount.
we can refuse payment and not give you a decryptor. can you afford it? what will you tell your clients?
we understand you and are ready to give you a decryptor right now. give us a good offer.
- never interrupt the decryption process by closing the program 
manually. the program may freeze during decryption, this is normal.
- after payment i will immediately give you decryptors.
- yes, we can decrypt your all files
- waiting for 3 confirmation and then send you decryptors
- linux decryption instruction:
1. upload decryptor to esxi.
2. set run permissions: chmod 777 decryptor
3. run decryptor: ./decryptor

- yes.
 - windows decryptor.
 - deleting data and blog post.
 - support for 2 days after decryption.
- in the case of payment, we guarantee:
  - non-disclosure of information about your hacking.

- i want you to understand one thing, it doesn't matter to me how long
 it takes to discuss the price. this is important for you. the faster 
you get decryptors, the faster you will continue to make money.
- use the last decryptor. he will decrypt them.
- you will receive a master (universal) decryptor for your linux and windows network after payment
- and how much was decrypted?
- you are very small client, see your infrastructure, after agreement and payment
1) we will decrypt instantly your network
2) if you need - provide file tree , with all taken files
3) delete data from our servers

some random files for proof:

don`t waste our time, how we don`t wasting your. rules for all clients same.

thank for understanding
- after payment you will receive decryptor for all your network.
- after payment you'll immediately receive decryptor for all network
- linux decryptor decrypts all system, it cant decrypt certain files
- no, it doesn't. if backups are on windows - use the windows decryptor.
- you showed me a log in which the decryptor is trying to decrypt empty files. so the problem arose before decryption.
why so, i can not answer you, there can be a lot of reasons.
- after decryption you can use your vms as before that
- yes. we will send the decrypted files shortly
- try the last decryptor.
- have other files been decrypted? are virtual machines working?
- which file was not decrypted? give more information.
- use this one decryptor for you esxi
