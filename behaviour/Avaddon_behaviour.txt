of your network is located in armenia, our policy of work does not allow

with which you can decrypt your entire network. we strongly apologize

clients have no problems with decrypting files, you need to listen to 
negotiators less and then you will have no problems

you now better buy a decryption, and finish this business already
- if we do not agree on a price for the 
buyback and you do not pay, then we will wait until you fully restore 
your entire online infrastructure and we deliver a second impact, and 
believe me, this blow will be more destructive, you will lose a lot more
 money and get more problems. as there will be a second wave of data 
leakage which will be measured by terabytes of data. we are ready to 
discuss the new price with you and remove your company data from our 
data breach blog. after payment, we will give you a decryptor that will 
decrypt absolutely all pcs / servers on your network, delete the files 
(we will provide proofs that the files have been deleted) and provide 
you with a list of vulnerabilities, with the help of this list you can 
eliminate all the vulnerabilities in your network and this situation 
cannot happen again with you in the future
- you can test decrypt only image file, not (.pdf .xlsx .txt ...). you have the ability to decrypt 1 image file up to 2 mb each.

- we can not make a discount only for one computer.

 it does not suit us at all. before we set you a price of $150,000, we 
analyzed your profitability and your capabilities in general, this price
 was taken not from the sky, but according to specific criteria, and by 
analysis.

- we have already offered you a very large 
discount, which we do not do for other clients. we have made a 50% 
discount for you.

- we are here 24/7, for all your questions, write here and we will help you.
- about vulnerabilities in your network. these are weak passwords and old operating systems, the operating systems that you used have vulnerabilities, with the help of them an attack was carried out on your network. use strong passwords and hide them as best as possible and update all your os to the latest versions.
- talk to the boss and explain to him that he 
needs to pay a ransom if he wants to save time and not lose even more 
money for restoring the work order.
- we want to talk to your boss.
- we will prepare a small archive for you today and send it to you.
- you need to offer more so that we can work.

- 11,000 $ are not enough.

company. the company can afford to pay this amount. you yourself got 
yourself in a dead end when you wanted to pay from your pocket. here we 
will not be able to help.
- have you already figured out the problem? because the address is correct, the problem is on your part.
- we are ready to make a very big discount for
 you. $ 35,000 this is our last proposal, it cannot be less.
- hello!
- contact us if you see this, it looks like we have a misunderstanding.
- are you already aware of the situation?
- your price is $40,000.
- how much can you offer? as we already wrote,
 the amount of $ 15,000 or $ 20,000 does not interest us.

PAYMENT:
- you can just send 0.24 btc
- you need to send 0.0276 btc to bitcoin address: [redacted]
- you need to buy bitcoin = 0.0277 btc and then send it to the wallet [redacted]
- you need to send 1.44 btc to bitcoin address: [redacted]
- 0.0243 btc
- 0.024 btc is a minimum
- ok, 0.0277 btc
- if payment is not made within 24 hours, we will publish a post about the leakage of your data, make mass spam by emails of your competitors, clients, partners and tell them that all confidential data that they had associated with you was leaked through your fault. believe me, we know how much money will be spent on investigations and lawsuits. it will be much more than 55k.
- you need to pay the amount in btc indicated on your page. the amount at the time of payment must be exactly the same as on the page!
- when will be ready to pay, ask and we will write you the exact amount in btc.
- look, you could write to us right away, we 
would have settled this issue and you resumed your work a few weeks ago,
 but for some reason you did not want to do this ... yes sir, 
vulnerabilities are found every day, but there were many holes in your 
network, we are ready to point you to them and tell you what to do so 
that they are closed, we will help you secure your network and if in the
 future you keep our advice it will be practically impossible to crack, 
but you will receive instructions on how to close the holes and secure 
your network only after payment. we understand that financial losses are
 possible in your business now and we understand perfectly well what 
will happen if we deliver the second impact, the second blow will mean 
an absolute collapse for you. we do not want to do this (we even reduced
 the price for you from 1kk to 200k), but we will have to if we do not 
now agree with you on the price for the buyback. make a meeting with the
 management or people who are responsible for finances in your company, 
explain to them the current situation and what awaits you in the future,
 if we do not agree on the price for the ransom and offer us your price,
 we are waiting for an answer from you, because time is ticking, and for
 you, time is money.
- i hope you pay and i don’t have to tell you what else we will do with your network in case of non-payment...

DATA_HANDLING:
- and we will tell you that $ 15,000 is still 
not enough, and we do not agree to such a small amount. suggest more or 
we will use other methods. we can share your financial statements, your 
employee and customer data, and more in the public domain. use ddos. we 
can completely ruin the reputation of your business. then you will have a
 lot of problems and you will suffer a lot of damage. you choose ...
- we can make a very big discount for you. you
 need to pay $ 30,000. if you want to return your files, you need to pay
 this amount. this is the last discount, the price cannot be lower.
- if you want to return your files and do not 
want us to create a post about your company and have posted information 
about you there, then you need to offer us more than $ 10,000.
- you cannot recover files without our unique key.
- evidence that we have the files and we will publish them if you don’t find the money.
- if you refuse to pay the amount specified on
 the page, you can see all your files in our blog for leaks. i think you
 do not want, and your company is important reputation.
- we can send you some random files so that 
you can be sure that we have the files. we will not send the tree. but 
just know that we have a lot of files and the leak is big, if you do not
 understand the severity of the situation, go and read our blog.
- make a photo of your passport against your face. then make a photo of the passport on the background of the monitor with encrypted files, you can open the properties of the file. send us a photo through the service https://www.sendspace.com/
- https://anonfiles.com/[redacted]/[redacted]_randomproof_7z
- take a loan or find money in some other way, if your files are important to you, then you will find money.
- we will give you additional time to search for money, and we will not publish a publication about your data leak while you are looking for money.
- sir, it seems to us that you do not quite 
understand the seriousness of the situation by offering us such a small 
price. before the price of $ 45,000 for your network was set, we carried
 out a detailed analysis of your company's income and financial 
statements. we know about your financial capabilities so the price 
offered we are not satisfied with you. we are ready to give you a 
discount and offer $ 30,000 this is the lowest price. the files that we 
showed you are just a drop in the ocean, in fact, we have about 10gb of 
data pulled from your network and this data includes finance and 
accounting, passports, credit card data, agreements and contracts, tax 
data of your company for the last few years, confidential documents, 
data on your clients and tens of thousands of other data. imagine the 
scale of the leak of this data and what consequences it will entail, 
such as lawsuits and proceedings. your reputation will be severely 
collapsed. also, if we make a post about you on the blog, then a ddos 
attack will fall on your site 24/7 and your site will simply be 
inaccessible to your customers. most importantly, this is not all that 
awaits you in our arsenal there are many more tools and techniques with 
which we will harm you more and more every day. we are a serious threat 
to your company and we ask you to take us and our proposals seriously. 
consider our proposed price of $ 30,000 and let's cooperate.
- do you need confirmation that we have the data? this is not a problem, we will provide them to you. just tell us to do it.
- guys, you do not understand, you have a lot of problems. to restore the normal mode of operation, you need a lot of time and money. if you do not pay, then you are waiting for news in our blog, we will publish a lot of your files that you will not like. you will get damage to much more than $ 55,000. we offer you a solution to all these issues for an adequate price.
- take it. we've stolen over 25gb of data from your network. what if i tell you the exact number of files? these are 50382 files!
- you need to offer more if you do not want us to publish your files.
- didn't you download the old archive? there is data.
- i ask this because we are already dealing with your files and soon they will be on the blog
- we have a lot of your important files that 
we will publish on our blog if you do not cooperate with us.
