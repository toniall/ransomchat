DATA_HANDLING:
- if so let us know, we wil prepare more data for download
- have you received files? do you need more ?
- we just checked the random db, data is fine and not encrypted. have a look.
https://ibb.co/[redacted]
- how you evaluate data’s price can i see a formula?
- you're right. usually we directly download files instead of download  whole vm.
- all backups was securely deleted to prevent you from recovery process. everything else was encrypted, we will prepare archive with stolen data in 30 mins, stay in touch.
- price and timer updated. tell to you manager that he must think twice, lost encrypted data and publish whole company secrets versus 2.5m$.
- we cannot share files like you asking for because it is database files, and one of them is database of backup software. timer updated.

ENCRYPTION:
- to decrypt your files you have to purchase the decryption software. it costs $15m for you.
- without any conditions, you are paying for decrypting tools and fast recovery, the data is collateral. you will not recover so easily without decryptor. we can do negotiations pretty long; time is on our side. if you are want to finish this fast make the acceptable offer.
- you see the demanded price. if you’ll pay it you will get.
1.	the decrypting tools.
2.	your data back (we took 1.5tb, pii, nda, emails, mssql databases)
3.	a file tree.
4.	explanation how the company was breached.
- first of all we add 3more days in timer. 1. we will setup temporary onion website where you can download your files to understand which ones was downloaded. 2. we will provide shreder log-files with reports of deleted files so you will compare it with files ha you download. 3. support for decryption available 24/7/365, but don't have any cases where it was needed. 4. short penetration-test report with main killchain and recommendations how to prevent this in future. 5. data in blog published only when we lost contact, so dont worry about it.

PROOF:
- we have the doubts you are from company we need the proofs that you are from there.

PAYMENT:
- we have no idea what a price is adequate for you. we can make 10% discount for fast payment and remove 25% btc transaction fee.  make the offer. but to make it simple we will not consider the offer less than 7-figure number.
