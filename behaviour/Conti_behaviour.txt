- support: talked to my boss. when he heard about the decryption tool being needed, at first he was ready to move back to the previous offer or at least move to 1.2mil (x2 from the data offer), but we've decided not too be hard on you and are ready to stay at $750k. take this to the management and let me know what they decide.
- glad to hear it. i am trying to find a suitable legacy wallet, but the fact is that we almost never use them, so it might take some time. anyways, if you will be able to transfer the funds to any of the above wallets we will accept the deposit and provide you with a decryptor. those three wallets are static and under our control.
- support: your network was attacked, your computers and servers were locked.
take into consideration that we have also downloaded data from your network that in case of not making payment will be published on our news website. after the payment you will get decryptor to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked.
we downloaded all employees private info, company's financial documents and etc. in case of not making payment will be also published.
more than 300gb of private information has been downloaded from your servers. including financial data of your company, personal data of your employees and their family members, company agreements, and most importantly, personal data of patients with their ssn, dob, addresses and diagnoses of diseases.
- hello. in addition to encrypting your files, we also downloaded important data from your network. we can provide you with a list of the files that we took from you, from this list you can choose any 2 files to make sure that we have the physical presence of your files. you can also select any 2 files and send them to us and we will decrypt them for you to make sure that your decrypted key is working. in order to avoid disclosure of your data on our website contunews.icu, get the decrypt key and security advice, you must pay a ransom of $ 3.000.000
- support: we think that you do not understand the seriousness and waste our time. also you are making all movements very slow. also, you could split the amount, pay us 15btc and we will give decrypt tool for example. the rest 10btc you could in 2 weeks and we will delete your data. so, we will start to upload your data anyway today, maybe it will rush you and your boss.
- the decryptor works for the entire network. we have no offer for one computer. we expect a reasonable offer from you before the end of the week, if the offer does not come from you, we are forced to start publishing. but we are ready to take steps to meet. our offer given your offer is $800,000
- your network was hacked, infrastructure encrypted and we downloaded many private information from your servers. 
important!
we have instructions and follow them, they do not change.
important! 
read carefully:

2. we have 14 days to negotiate! the end of the term, the base price will be doubled & we will publish you for the purpose of selling access to your network and datas of your company.
3. but there is also a positive point in our conditions, if you pay quickly during the week, then the discount will be from the base price of -30%.
4. the discount price (14 days from that date) will be: $840,000
5. btc wallet: [redacted]

- in 2 days i' ll start publish your data
- support: good morning. as i promised earlier i will send you one sql base from server [internal ip address] . it's still preparing. but i won't give you any more files. if we do not come to an agreement, then you will see all your databases for free on the cartel's news servers. there will be many surprises for you.
- please review the full listing and let us know when we can start shredding your data to provide the deletion log.
- support: after the conclusion of the agreement, we overwrite the data
- support: while you were solving your problems of finding money, we downloaded another 40gb of data with the diagnoses of your patients.
- support: it is taking too long. we want to know it tomorrow. you have talk to your bosses and explain them the seriousness of the situation. also they should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data.
- if we will not receive the reply from your side we will start contacting all of your clients and employees to notify them about the breach and on how you mantain privacy and information security and on how you value their data.
- if you continue to remain silent, on monday we will make a publication confirming the data leak and hacking of your network.
- logo.png.data [ 32kb ]
- we are looking for those files. will upload soon.
- [redacted]data.zip [ 74.2mb ]
- yes, these are all the files. we didn't take many files, but enough to publish and send to those who may be very interested in them in case our negotiations are not successful.
- support: we could give you 
discount if you pay shortly. also you should remember that we own all 
corporate data, including personal info of the employees, clients data, 
emails chats and etc. if you do not pay us, we will start to publish and
 sell that data. think about your reputation.
- guys you don' t understand. in your situation, you are not telling us what to do, but vice versa. 2 business days left before we start uploading your private data.
- support: well we start to publish your data. here is the web link:
https://continews.best/[redacted]
if you want to stop that process you have last chance for that. otherwise the most valuable part of info will be sold on the black markets and the the rest will be published. private data of your employees and clients is under the risk, you have to think about it.
- support: nope cause all files are zipped. why are you asking this question again? your admins don't know what files they have on server  [internal ip address]?
- support: now we start to collect all patient's emails from data we have collected from your servers. all patients will be notified about the leakage of their personal data from your servers.
- we can't find the files you requested by path. we need the exact file names to look for.
- 30%_data_[redacted].txt.7z [ 794kb ]
- support: if there is no money, then there is no agreement. i think when we start spreading your information it will spur you on and you will find money to save yourself from even larger losses. we consulted with lawyers and calculated that only the fines for the leakage of personal data will exceed the amount we ask for several times. i am not even mentioning what losses you will incur in the future because of a damaged business reputation. you have no more time. please make a decision on which path you are going.
- support: good day. do not think that we have forgotten about you. just busy at the end of the year with more important things. we have already agreed with partners to publish your patient's private data. also next week we will send out a press release for companies involved in the field of computer security. but you still have time.......
- support: sql databases are very large. to download them, we compressed them. all your data is archived on servers. you are not the only company with which we are negotiating and we have neither time nor free disk space to unzip the data of each locked client.
- support: we understand that your board is more puzzled by its holidays than by this problem. in our opinion, if people want to solve a problem quickly and not against the interests of other people, then they gather and make efforts for this.of course, we will give you time until monday only because we do not want ordinary employees and patients of your company to suffer from the leakage of their personal data. we also ask you to transfer to the board so that they speed up and do not delay solutions to this situation.
- support: good morning. we still did not get any offer from you. if we don't hear it today, we will start publishing your private data.
- $75,000?
don't try to cheat us.
we have got a lot of your data and encrypted your system.
we have got a serious amount of your contracts and documentation.
we have the personal data of your employees.
we got a lot of information about your company from our pentest and osint departments.
and you are trying to offer us a bit more than the yearly salary of a regular manager?
this sum can cover only a part of the total amount we can get by selling your data and vulnerabilities on auctions.
moreover, because we are now aware of your network structure, the next attack can be implemented in a short time.
it looks like you think we are stupid. just a simple pentest on your company will cost about $40-50 thousand. and this is a price without stolen data.
you have one more chance to give us an adequate offer. otherwise, we will raise the ransom amount.
we can only give you a small discount, if you decide to pay in 24 hours. let your price be $250,000.
- support: you can check out the press release on our news site : https://continews.best/[redacted]
if you are not going to get in touch with us - we will continue publishing all the data we have.
- on tuesday, we will begin publishing and selling your data. you are only a small loss of profit for us.
- we will also try to find a buyer for your data and access to your network if you refuse to pay.
- we have 450gb of your data. you can choose any two files from this listing, we will upload them to you, this is proof that we have them.
wait, soon we will write you the terms of cooperation.
- support: according to the public records your revenue is [more than 30],000,000$, so this price is reasonable. 
https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.[redacted].html
also you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data.
- support: it's pretty much data so it keeps being uploaded. will update you as soon as it's ready.
- well, yes, i suppose. but please specify the database name too.
- this file contains the 30% list of all the data we took from your network. it totally costs what we ask.
- support: https://www.sendspace.com/file/[redacted]
is this critical data for the board?
- the total amount of data downloaded from your network is 835 gb.
the 30% of the whole file listing is attached. you can choose any 2 files from the list and we will upload them as a proof.
- support: we will return all your data and provide security report.
- support: it is not enough compare to your revenue and data which we got from you. so you could use this option and pay in two steps. you could start to work properly even today and find the rest very fast.
- these are directory. your files are removed. we work honestly.
- evaluate our offer, it is balanced and realistic, we understand your desire to reduce the costs of this incident. but let's be realistic, we have blocked all your infrastructure and threaten to publish data that in the long run + not installed infrastructure will make your losses many times the amount we ask. let's go ahead, people who tell the management of your company that they can reduce the price - make mistakes, this will not happen. our price is final. it will only grow. ahead of the pullout of your data. you need to discuss this well before pulling time and then biting your elbows why the price has risen so much.
- support: it is more then enough. you should understand that downloading data is very easy process when you have an access to the whole system.
- do you need the list of the data that was taken from their network?
- - we recommend that you configure restrictions on system actions for ordinary users on all workstations.
- change passwords every 2 weeks and create more complex
- install an antivirus on every computer 
- disable lsas dump on all computers
- monitoring of users on the network 2 times a week
- restrict access to servers for regular users
- reduce the number of domain admins
- set up a more complex data backup system
- support: that is not enough. we could reduce the price and give you a new offer 700,000$. you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data(ids, ssn, credit cards).
- support: if you think that your personal data is cheaper, offer a price. $1,200,000 is unacceptable.
- you may refuse to pay this your choice. then we'll release your hacking information. if this does not make you aware, we will publish some of your data for sale to interested parties. we took a step to meet. now it's your turn. we're waiting for your best offer.
- we will provide the data deletion log soon. unfortunately we have no records on what account was the initially infected. sorry.
- support: https://www.databreaches.net/[redacted]/
- support: so should we start posting of your data?
- support: we can unzip all your downloaded databases, analyze information from them and provide you with data. but it will take a long time and most importantly, we will return to the original price. i don't think it will suit you.
- we see that you do not want to solve your problem. we are going to start publishing your data tomorrow.
- support: i will convey your decision to my management. if it is rejected, then we start publishing your data. you have an hour to change your mind.
- we have over 1 million files stolen from your network
total weight over 400 gigabytes
- it took you two days to download files from review? we are not that patient and you should be more operative otherwise we will consider you stalling
- support: once again, we ask you to pass this information on to your management. we are also aware that you have insurance against these cases. 
if your management does not contact us within 3 days, we will begin to publish your private data.
- support: good morning, please transfer these files to albert maury and ann mary pardo https://www.sendspace.com/file/[redacted]
- support: of course, the price is high, but it is much, much more cheaper, than pay to all the lawsuits, that your clients will send to you, because you have lost so much of their data. companies of your size can lost tens of millions in such cases.
https://www.zdnet.com/article/easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach/
this is one of the examples.
- i will provide the data pack example later today.
- support: overall price is $900,000. for this price you will get everything mentioned above. please pass this information on to your management. in the future, we are ready to communicate only with the representative who can make such decisions. we are ready to provide you with a small set of files from different servers of your company.
- [redacted]_data.7z [ 4.6mb ]
- it is currently unpacking, but as soon as it's ready you will be provided with the file listing that will contain 30% of all the data and some files examples. you will be able to choose two random files from the listing and we will upload them as a proof.

we went to your meeting, gave you a good discount. you started pulling time and making us brains. we don't like it. measures will follow to sober you up. think three times before you start playing script games with us.
- support: well we start to 
publish your data. here is the web link:
https://continews.best/[redacted]
if you want to stop that process you have last chance for that. 
otherwise the most valuable part of info will be sold on the black 
markets and the the rest will be published. private data of your 
employees and clients is under the risk, you have to think about it.
- datapack-example.zip [ 1.9mb ]
- support: we think that you are 
not completely aware of the seriousness of the situation. in the event 
of a further delay, we will be able to use information resource 
https://continews.best and will start to sell you private data on the 
black markets.
we will publish the full dump of your data on our news website with 
1,000 visitors per day, 50% of them are mass media reporters and 
regulators, the other part is blackhat hackers. we are not interested in
 this, and we gain nothing from data publication, that is why we are 
offer you a deal.
1) your clients data will be used by criminals
2) your clients will fill lawsuit against you
3) government regulators will fine you for data breach, if you have in 
clients at least one eu resident then you will be also fined by eu 
government by gdpr law with millions of dollars of fine or permit ban 
for working with eu citizents. us has the similar laws, but they are not
 so costly, however the total cost will exceed the asked amount from 
you, so our offer is the best deal for you to resolve this issue.
- support: we gave the price. it is just beginning. we have much more data which will be posted or sold on the black markets.
- support: are you convinced? there is really a lot of your data here
- smalllogo.png.data [ 16kb ]
- we are ready to publish first data
silence will kill your business
it is much more profitable to conclude an agreement with us
- support: this price is indicated for restoring all data in your network and deleting data on our servers
- support: normally is several enough. we do not keep data on hard drives, it is all in clouds. so it is complicated process to show several more files. also you should understand that downloading process is very easy compare to hacking process. we mean that if we broke your system, get your data is the easiest part.
- support: this is not what we agreed on. we gave you time to search for funds and not to fish out new information from us. we are waiting for a new proposal from you and we will give you a few more files.
- support: no. we took much more, around 1 terabyte. we wrote that previously too, including the data of clients and employees.
- support: we value our reputation and never leak any data after the deal is closed
- example_datapack.rar [ 689kb ]
- support: ok. we could reduce the price and offer the new amount 500,000$. the price is more then reasonable for that data and your reputation.
- understandable. too bad though. we will start auctioning your data to your competitors within next 48 hours.
- data pack [redacted].zip [ 38.9mb ]
- support: yes, we are unpacking a terabyte. it will take a lot of time.
you can select any file from the listing and we will discard it as proof that we have these files.
- that's as low as we can get. and it's not only about the files that we've shown. i will upload the full listing soon, but if we won't be able to reach the agreement by tomorrow - we shall start notifying your employees and partners about the breach and on how you value their data.
- yes. we have them. although we have already provided two files of your choice that you have requested i can provide only parts of those files as a confirmation.

- support: as i told you before we will share more files with you after your proposal. sorry my management told me not to make any exceptions. we already told you that we found a lot of credit card with cardholders info.
- both you and we are well aware that you will incur losses many times greater than the amount requested if your files are published and your network is in an encrypted state. in addition, trying to recover your files yourself will result in their loss and destruction, keep in mind.
- if we will not receive the response today we shall start transmitting your data to 3-rd parties step by step notifying your clients and employees about the breach and on how you guard their data.
- support: packing data into an archive provides compression up to 95%
- support: we will start to publish and sell your data on monday if you do not answer.
- support: also, your notifications will not save private data of your employees and customers, it will be used long time in many bad purposes. think about your reputation, which will be damaged in so hard times for business.
- support: we are ready to listen to your proposal and after it we will give you more files. time is running out please don't delay. we have to close the deal this week.
- yes, send 2-3 files to the chat room
- support: we think that you are not completely aware of the seriousness of the situation. in the event of a further delay, we will be able to use information resource https://continews.best and will start to sell you private data on the black markets.
we will publish the full dump of your data on our news website with 1,000 visitors per day, 50% of them are mass media reporters and regulators, the other part is blackhat hackers. we are not interested in this, and we gain nothing from data publication, that is why we are offer you a deal.
1) your clients data will be used by criminals
2) your clients will fill lawsuit against you
3) government regulators will fine you for data breach, if you have in clients at least one eu resident then you will be also fined by eu government by gdpr law with millions of dollars of fine or permit ban for working with eu citizents. us has the similar laws, but they are not so costly, however the total cost will exceed the asked amount from you, so our offer is the best deal for you to resolve this issue.
- support: we looked throw your finance records, bank accounts and know that you have more available funds. we are ready to give you some discount, but that price is not reasonable. we own a lot of private data which cost much more.
- support: 2. here is the web links on your data:

- you can choose not to pay and then your data will be published in the media with subsequent sale.
- support: that is still very low.we could earn more profit if we sell your data. so you should make better offer.
- support: ok. we are confirming this. the size of the data which was taken is more then 50tb, as we told you previously this files are from 96 servers and 500 desktops.
- support: we've already sent you proofs. private data (like ssn, dob) of your staff, data of clients, their diagnoses and your top-management data are not enough?
we perfectly understand, that you are following the tutorial, no offence by that. staff data doesn't worth anything for you? 
but if we will just say for a moment, that there is an announcement on our news site (and the rest of the cartel news sites), that your company had lost private data of your customers,patient ... us part of the revenue will go to zero, just as number of possible new contracts. we've already done such things before, and our "customers" were forced to face the grim consequences. we think, that there is no point in efforts to display more proofs. situation is perfectly clear and we're already in the middle of negotiations.
of course, we just want to make money, and not to destroy business of our clients. we hope, that your board have enough commerce sense to make right choices.
- support: we've discussed, despite the fact that my boss considers our last offer reasonable i managed to convince him to review it. he agreed to go down to $600k if the deal will be closed by the end of this week. once the transfer is made you will be provided with security recommendations on network improvement, breach details, all you files will be completely wiped from our servers once and for all. 
also we can upload your files to mega.nz secure share and provide you with full access to it. that's a fair offer and i did everything possible to make it work. hope you appreciate.
- support: that is not enough. your private data cost much more on the black market because it includes a lot of private info(ids, ssn and etc). you should make better offer.
- support: we have a lot of your data from more then 90 servers and 500 desktops. hurry up, it is a lot of private data. otherwise we will start to look for clients on it and the price will raise.
- well, it's way more than 2 files, but we will provide.
- you have been waiting to contact us for about three weeks while ignoring our emails and still ask for a discount? it's a luck that you data isn't published yet. it's way past the deadline.
- support: the longer we study your files, the more important information we find in them. credit card information will be one of the most expensive in the event of a defect.
- if you delay the negotiations, on monday we will release information about the fact of hacking your network. further, if you do not understand this, we will publish part of the data to find a buyer for them.
- no, we are not satisfied, these are ridiculous numbers. in 3 days we will start to publish your data on our website and send it to interested parties, also this chat will be deleted, in the future you will not be able to get a transcript. good luck.
- keep it. we will publish your data and  it will be a good example for the other companies.
- support: we already sent you files and told that we took data from 96 servers and more then 500 desktops. is it not understandable for you?
- support: total of data more 1tb
- support: more than 1 million personal data will be published soon.

but you can still avoid your data being disclosed and finally stop it. you know what to do. you have been provided with the instructions already. 
just to let you know - we dont care who pays for the data. your company or our partners. the only thing you should care is your reputation being at high risk at the moment. once your data is transmitted in full - you wont be able to abort this operation. you will have to deal with consequences of your disregard.
- support: publishing data will cause customer churn and you will lose much more. it is more profitable to work with us
- do you remember that we've had access to your network and went through your financial data? we wouldn't ask for anything you are unable to afford.
- in addition, we stole your 50 gigabyte data
within 24 hours, we will download the list of what downloaded from your network

- support: thanks for an update. we can give you a good discount again if you are ready to make a deal on the price today.we are ready to divide the amount into 2 payments.
- that is totally impossible. we have discussed internally and the lowest we can get is $350k. i am not authorized to accept any lower payment.
- support: ok. $450k. btc wallet : [redacted]
- correct. the wallet for the payment is:
[redacted]
- contact us immediately as the payment of $150,000 will be sent.
- the btc wallet for the payment is : [redacted]
let me know as soon as the payment is made.
- any success with the payment?
- the btc wallet remains the same : [redacted]
- bitcoin address for payment: [redacted]
- i have to go offline for a while, let me know if you succeed with the payment. seems like the bitcoin pools are feeling better based on the fact that we've managed to make several transactions today. all the provided wallets will be valid for the next 24 hours so you can choose any of them.
- support: amount of money we want is just a small piece of your possible losses including but not limiting direct expenses such as payments for data recovery, dramatic cash flow drop, legal & government fines, attorneys & lawyers interests, but also reputation impact resulting in long-term customer abandonment.
- support: we received payment and provide required info shortly.
- support: good morning. please update us with payment time frame.
- we are ready to accept $256k. i will provide the wallet for the payment a bit later today.
- the 20% discount was confirmed. so we are at the point of $280k
let me know when you're ready to pay and we will provide the btc wallet
- we have your accounting, legal documents, finance,  contracts and personal correspondence, db, that's all i can say. it's about 200 gigabate. you will receive a complete list of files after payment as well as a log of their removal from our server.
- the payment amount is 1 500 000 $ and if you pay by tomorrow evening (european time) lets arrange april 2nd by midnight - you will get extra discount of 30% - so the total amount will be 1 050 000$ it is quite generous from our side.  after successful transfer - we forget about this small incident and disappear with all data shredded !!!
- we can make 25% discount if the payment will be made within 24 hours.
- support: could you give some proof that the bank is slowing down the loan payment? forward the emails from bank to [redacted]@outlook.com
- you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don' t reach an agreement, we' ll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. that is much more serious threat, than none making payment to us.
- support: our btc wallet [redacted]
- support: we could make additional discount 5btc. we will not wait for several weeks and keep the price on the same level. that price is valid till the end of the week. ok?
- we can provide a 25% discount by going down to $635k if the payment will be made by the end of this week.
- support: you no longer need to write here that the bank is slowing down payment, etc. specifically, you must give the date of payment. the games are over.
- support: the btc wallet is the same : [redacted]
- support: that is not reasonable price for so huge batch of data. you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data. so, our offer is 25btc.
- you'll get everything within 24 hours. after payment.
- we are ready to provide a 25% discount if the payment will be made by monday.
- your network was hacked, workstations encrypted and we downloaded many private information from your servers. note that we have also downloaded a lot of data from your network that in case of not making payment will be published on our website.
if you will spend 3 days in silence we will start publushing the information.
- yes, we are ready to accept the payment.
and no, i meant your recovery company. nevermind though, i might be mistaken.
- support: sorry, but we do not believe you that a company of your size does not have 200-300k on the account to make an advance payment as confirmation of your intentions. sorry, but you had enough time to solve your problems with the bank.
- 10.68 btc
- support: i have a final decision on [redacted]. the negotiations are over. you have 48 hour left to make a payment to our bitcoin wallet. before transferring bitcoins, you need to confirm the wallet. the countdown went from 3:00pm est. our management has developed a special plan in case the funds are not received on time. and for you it really will be a "surprise".
- 2\3 payments accepted
- support: ok. we could give additional discount and price now is 44btc.
- support: good morning. why are you asking questions that have already been answered? the full file tree will be provided to you only after payment. unfortunately, we already had a sad experience when we gave a complete list of downloaded data before paying. in our opinion, we have provided you with a fairly complete picture that we have all sensitive information that was stored on your file servers, sql databases, as well as in your medical programs. if you want to take the risk and not negotiate with us, then this is your right. but trust our experience that in this case your expenses will far exceed the cost of $ 10 million.
- okay, this is closer to a good offer. we can accept $175,000 if payment will be provided in 2 days.
- support: you have our btc wallet [redacted].
- i cannot provide any non-speculative answer to this question cause it's connected to an ongoing business enterprise. for now it seems to me like i am giving a public interview and as i have already told - we have no interest in spreading our position or opinion. although i can provide you with some personal view of the situation after the payment is received and i become confident on whom i am speaking to.
- support: that is correct. as soon as we receive payment we provide required info.
- support: when do you expect to proceed with the payment?
- support: you are constantly pushing dates back. we have a strong opinion that you are just playing for time. if you really want to close the case, then you need to transfer any amount on friday to our btc wallet. otherwise, we will be forced to start the procedure for publishing your data.
- btc wallet: [redacted]
- support: so you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. if we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit. and on other hand, you would be ruined. that is much more serious threat, than none making payment to us.
- support: we could even make some more, so price is 39btc.
