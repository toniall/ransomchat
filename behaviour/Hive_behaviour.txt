
OTHER:
- select any without important info in it and we will upload it for you
- of course not prng:)
- please, introduce your company first
- how is it going with decision making?
- yes, your company has $2b revenue. we usually rate 1% of revenue
- yes, our wallet  [redacted]
- done
- we will not wait forever. you have to decide.
- for esxi servers it's not possible
- hello
- i'll share with you later when my teammate will be online.
- yes, not so much, but it will be enough to confirm the incedent
- the price is not a subject to discuss.
- for all of course
- don't worry you have time. tell me how is it going with upper management please
- hi
- done, you can check it.
- okay.
- the encryptor didn't uploaded yet, looking for it rn.
- no, a truly cryptographic random field.
- okay
- it was necessary because whether i upload the encryptor other researchers will be able to login and read your conversation.
- to convince you to pay we can make calls to your partners and customers to notify them about the incident.
- hello! waiting for your decision, otherwise i will be forced to raise the price if ignored and put your information on my information auction.
- we don't provide any hashes. every time the software is unique. there is  no need of hashes here. it will not help anyway.
- actually i didn't spend too much time to hide it but i will
- ok
- i need to hear an update from you today
- i'm sure this situation will be resolved
- i offer you $2,500,000 and it's valid until the end of the weekend.
- it's true. first 4kb, the last, and a few blocks in the middle
- our target is a company that allowed a huge vulnerability in its system that led to a massive infection of [redacted-software-vendor]'s customer network. accordingly, this company must resolve this issue and justify the trust of its customers.
- it's clearly the price is $3.5m
- yes, we attack every targets, we have no limits here. it's not related with honesty
- how may i help you?
- i made an offer at the right panel
- the encryptor software rewrites the key from memory.
- in my opinion spending money to external it companies will only waste your valuable time.
- the price isn't negotiable. i'll wait, there is no hurry
- reconnect for what?
- send us email from your corporate mail account to this address to verify it's you:

[redacted]_support@protonmail.com
- the price isn't negotiable.
- we have 32 gb total. 
almost all antiviruses are useless against real hackers.
- wait a little bit. we'll get to step 1 soon.
- okay, i agree
- i'll wait
- hello and welcome to hive.
how may i help you?
- yes, we will do that in few hours.
- i'll fix the number at the company's profile but it will not change anything.
- what a recovery company are you from?
- thank you
- we are all honest who works at hive
- hello. please, introduce your company first.
- i have extended it
- the price is $500,000.
- no
- if you want a discount i would like to see for how much
- we will answer you a little bit later.
- i have another option for you. you will give me your email address (protonmail is preferred) and i'll send you new credentials to login. then i'll upload the encryptor to virustotal and provide you a link to it. all necessary hashes will be available there. 
but to prevent others to login to your customer website you have to get new credentials first.
- obviously you don't know that our goal is not you, our goal is [redacted-software-vendor] which has the profits to cover all recovery costs. once again, we want to hold [redacted-software-vendor] accountable in this panel to solve all your problems.
- to convince you to pay we can make calls to your partners to notify them about the incident.
- the offer has been created. there you can find a bitcoin address and approximate amount in it to pay
- hello?
- i can offer you $3,000,000 in bitcoin.
- unfortunately i can't accept this.
- i got it
- it's time to pay
- actually i already disclose you a lot of details which was never disclosed to anyone. i think it's enough to make a decision.
- the final price for you is $100,000.
- i didn't compare it with lockbit but my software is quite fast, especially esxi
- https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/12baa6c83e6f8b059e7f14cb67bdad4e917b90bc8a139b5379a4b42a0c92a6be?nocache=1
- yes
- let's play with the price. i think both your management and our side want to resolve this as quick as possible
- array of bytes in memory where the key resides in rewrites to prevent such operation
- okay, i'll give you time
- what do you mean about creds? from what?
- hi, how is it going?
- okay, few min
- i'm good too. i just wanted to know to what direction your company inclined right now. 

by the way, what about a recovery process from memory from recovery company you told earlier?
- here is safe now
- okay, i'll do my best
- i don't know. maybe today
- [redacted-software-vendor] is responsible for you at this time. you are advised to contact them for a speedy resolution of your problems.
- we are well-known organization. we honor our agreements. there is no point in the blacklist right now. you need to concentrate on how to collect money.
- you have to make a decision.

ENCRYPTION:
- recovery companies no matter what they say can't decrypt.
- after payment you will get:

1) the decryption software
2) promise of non-disclosure
3) access to exfiltrated files storage
4) security report
- we performed files analysis. the impact of disclosure and undecryptable files will cost you few times more then $3.5m.
to prove that we have exfiltrated files i give you a sample archive.

https://privatlab.com/s/v/nqqr2jo2b7syqebnp5y4
- to decrypt your files you will need to pay $500,000.
- decrypting your server and removing stolen confidential files from your servers costs you $200,000 in bitcoins.
- to decrypt your files you have to pay $20,000,000 in bitcoin.
- i have decrypted both files
- when encryptor starts it creates a random field which will be used in encryption process. it is static. after encryption process finishes it rewrites to prevent restoration process. rsa keys private and public only use to encrypt/decrypt the random field. only knowing the field it's possible to decrypt files. encryptor has only public rsa keys, decryptor - private rsa keys.
- all you need is to see that i have decrypted it. there is nothing to validate more
- after payment, you will receive:

1) transcription software
2) promise of non-disclosure
3) access to storage of decrypted files
4) security report 

 to convince you to pay, we can make calls to your customers to notify them of the incident.
- i have uploaded decrypted file
- we are well-known organization and our decryptor works. otherwise you would able to read about any issues with other companies which are hundreds.
- nothing. you will not be able to decrypt. your exfiltrated files will be disclosed. we will make calls to your partners and customers to notify them about the incident.
- to decrypt your files and prevent them to be disclosed you will need to pay $1,200,000.
- there is a spotted encryption mechanism. if you are talking about esxi files then i don't think they can. some text files - yes
- to prove the decryption software works you may upload few encrypted files and a key related to them. it usually locates at c:\*.key.* or at root of a shared folder
- unfortunately for them there are only two options: 
1) start from a scratch
2) purchase the decryption software from us
- so you will be able to do the same right after you'll purchase the decryption software
- to decrypt your files you have to pay $3,500,000 in bitcoin. the price is not a subject to discuss.
- aes is a chiper, i use a different one - some kind of vernam's chiper. it's impossible to decrypt without knowing the keys.
- only the main company are able to purchase the decryption software. it cost's $1,000,000 in bitcoin.
- i will not to disclose you any sensitive files until payment will be made. select other files if you still do not believe that the decryption software works.
- encryptor even don't know anything about private keys. it only has public keys. public keys need to encrypt random field which uses in encryption process.
- yes, to decrypt your files you have to pay $300,000 in bitcoin.
- to decrypt your files and to prevent them to be disclosed you will need to pay $500,000.
- i already decrypt these two last files you uploaded, but i can't send you them to you due to sensitive info inside
- let me explain to you something.
there is no other way to decrypt files other then to purchase the decryption software. the attempts to use something different then original software may cause irreversible damage. your files will be unable to decrypt!
- to decrypt your files you have to pay $3,500,000 in bitcoin.
- in simplified version the key used to encrypt all files. it exports to the disk using a few rsa public keys applied. then encryption process follows. after that the key rewrites to prevent recovery from memory. 

decryption software has rsa private keys to initially decrypt the exported key.

DATA_HANDLING:
- i don't know which hosts your data was downloaded from. we took only those files that were of interest and could be sold to third parties. typically, customer data, databases, financial reports, corporate email archives and other classified and confidential data related to the company's activities (technological developments, blueprints, drug clinical trials, software codes, etc.) are downloaded.
- you are able to upload encrypted files and a key file locates at c:\*.key.*
encrypted files must not contain important info in it.
